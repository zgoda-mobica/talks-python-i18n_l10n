# Pybabel example scripts

This directory contains example scripts that use pybabel to maintain message catalogs for Flask based web application but they may be adapted to any Python project. Example configuration has everything required to extract messages from [Jinja2 templates](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/extensions/#i18n-extension). For Flask based applications use of [Flask-Babel extension](https://github.com/python-babel/flask-babel) is highly recommended.

For more information on configuring Babel and using command-line interface see [Babel documentation](http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/cmdline.html).
